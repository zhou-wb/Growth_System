# Growth_System
Surface generated by growing curve

## Feb 27th
### Updates:
1. add coordinate system class
2. add surface generation based on local speed vector

### Problems:

The surface generation based on local speed vector and Frenet frame is not stable. So the next step is to test:
1. use more points to calculate the local Frenet frame
2. make the delta t small

I need to know which is the key factor to make the system stable
